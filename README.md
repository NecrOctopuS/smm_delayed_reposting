2. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
3. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)

### How to install
To get started, get a token from VK, it can be obtained as follows:

You must follow the link: https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=`Your_ID_client`&scope=photos,groups,wall,offline&response_type=token
where `Your_ID_ID` is the application ID that can be viewed in the settings of your [application](https://vk.com/apps?act=manage)

Next, you need to get a token from Telegram, you get it automatically by creating a bot.

You also need a key (access token) with the right to `publish_to_groups` from Facebook, you can get it by following the [link](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)

The following data must be written to the `.env` file:
```text
VK_ACCESS_TOKEN = "Your key to Vkontakte"
VK_CLIENT_ID = 'Your Vkontakte Application ID'
VK_GROUP_ID = 'ID of your VKontakte group'
VK_ALBUM_ID = 'ID of your Vkontakte album'

Then use `pip` (or` pip3`, there is a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
